# Instructions
# 1. Write a docstring that describes what is going to happen.
# 2. Set x, y, and z as equal to 2, 3, and 4.
# 3. Determine the Pythagorean distance between x, y, and z. c = âˆš(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
# 4. Include comments to clarify each line of code.

"""This program  will determine the Pythagorean distance between three points."""

#2. 
x, y, z = 2, 3, 4

#3. 
c_squared = x**2 + y**2 + z**2 
c = math.sqrt(c_squared)
